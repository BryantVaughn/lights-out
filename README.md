# Lights Out

This is a fun game that simulates the popular handheld electronic Lights Out game from the 90's. The objective of the game is to turn off all lights on the board.

### Instructions

Lights can be switched on/off by clicking on the specific light you want. Be careful, when you click on a light it will also toggle the lights that are above, below, left, and right of the one you selected. Can you win by turning all lights out?!
